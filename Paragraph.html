<h2 align="center">Winter Morning</h1>
<h3 align="center">A winter morning is cold and foggy. Everything seems hazy and indistinct. The grass remains wet with dew drops. When the sun rises, dew drops sprakle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to busk in the heat. Animals, too are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of house and try to save themselves from the bitting cold outside. People get up late in the morning. Old people and children get up a bit later to evade cold of the early morning. Working people get out of the doors when the fog disappears and when the sun is hot. People usually eat homemade cakes with ‘date juice’ and sitting outside their homes enjoy the warmth of the early sun. Bangalees settled abroad, make a it a point to come and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich.
Of the six seasons the winter is undoubtedly the coldest season in Bangladesh. There remains dense fog all around in winter. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sunrays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. As a result, communication system is disrupted. And it causes much hardship to people. Sometimes, cold waves blow throughout the country. The sun having risen the old and the children enjoy basking in the sun to get rid of cold. The dew drops fallen on the grass and the leaves sparkle like pearls in the rays of the morning sun. This scene makes the earth look beautiful. Date juice sellers become busy for selling date juice from door to door. People from all walks of life, especially villagers enjoy eating native cakes which are called ‘Pithas’ in Bangla. The scene of a winter morning is very transitory. This scene starts disappearing as the day advances.</h3>
<h2 align="center">Computer</h1>
<h3 align="center">A computer is an electronic device. It is one of the gifts of modern science. A computer can take input from the user and process this input data and if need. It follows the instructions unit in which we input. It takes input through keyboard, mouse etc and then it process the input data and give output on display screen and store data if need.
Computer was not invented overnight. It took long time and hard labor to invent computer. A British professor named Charles Babeg invented this machine.
There are three parts in a computer. They are 1. central processing unit 2. Input 3. and output. The central processing unit is the brain of the computer. The input part receives signals and output part gives the result.
Computers are of two kinds- the analogue and the digital. An analogue computer can solve the different problems of mathematics within a short time. A digital computer can do varieties of thing. Now a days a computer means a digital computer.
We use it in every sphere of our life. Now people can get access to many libraries, books, journals and various kinds of information in a minute through a computer. We can not suffer from any communication gap or loneliness, if we have a computer. We use internet through computers for sending mails, keep in touch with friends and family members through various kinds of blogs and social sites such as twitter or Facebook  Thus computer is very important in the present world. Rather, it is a need like a pen or pencil for a student in a school or classroom.
It has lessened our work loads, saved time and energy. It has made our life easy and comfortable. It is a part and parcel of our life.</h3>
