<h2 align="center">Winter Morning</h1>
<h3 align="center">A winter morning is cold and foggy. Everything seems hazy and indistinct. The grass remains wet with dew drops. When the sun rises, dew drops sprakle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to busk in the heat. Animals, too are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of house and try to save themselves from the bitting cold outside. People get up late in the morning. Old people and children get up a bit later to evade cold of the early morning. Working people get out of the doors when the fog disappears and when the sun is hot. People usually eat homemade cakes with ‘date juice’ and sitting outside their homes enjoy the warmth of the early sun. Bangalees settled abroad, make a it a point to come and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich.
Of the six seasons the winter is undoubtedly the coldest season in Bangladesh. There remains dense fog all around in winter. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sunrays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. As a result, communication system is disrupted. And it causes much hardship to people. Sometimes, cold waves blow throughout the country. The sun having risen the old and the children enjoy basking in the sun to get rid of cold. The dew drops fallen on the grass and the leaves sparkle like pearls in the rays of the morning sun. This scene makes the earth look beautiful. Date juice sellers become busy for selling date juice from door to door. People from all walks of life, especially villagers enjoy eating native cakes which are called ‘Pithas’ in Bangla. The scene of a winter morning is very transitory. This scene starts disappearing as the day advances.</h3>
<h2 align="center">Computer</h1>
<h3 align="center">A computer is an electronic device. It is one of the gifts of modern science. A computer can take input from the user and process this input data and if need. It follows the instructions unit in which we input. It takes input through keyboard, mouse etc and then it process the input data and give output on display screen and store data if need.
Computer was not invented overnight. It took long time and hard labor to invent computer. A British professor named Charles Babeg invented this machine.
There are three parts in a computer. They are 1. central processing unit 2. Input 3. and output. The central processing unit is the brain of the computer. The input part receives signals and output part gives the result.
Computers are of two kinds- the analogue and the digital. An analogue computer can solve the different problems of mathematics within a short time. A digital computer can do varieties of thing. Now a days a computer means a digital computer.
We use it in every sphere of our life. Now people can get access to many libraries, books, journals and various kinds of information in a minute through a computer. We can not suffer from any communication gap or loneliness, if we have a computer. We use internet through computers for sending mails, keep in touch with friends and family members through various kinds of blogs and social sites such as twitter or Facebook  Thus computer is very important in the present world. Rather, it is a need like a pen or pencil for a student in a school or classroom.
It has lessened our work loads, saved time and energy. It has made our life easy and comfortable. It is a part and parcel of our life.</h3>
<h2 align="center">Your Classroom</h2>
<h3 align="center">I am lucky that my class-room is situated in the far side such that the noises of the road and market are not audible there.

There are four windows—two in either side of the walls. On the third wall, there is the fixed large transparent black-board on which the teachers write with chalk for the benefit of the students.The teacher sits in the chair while taking the roll- call or when she gives a test to the students or when she is not writing on the blackboard. She places the Attendance Register, the chalk-box and the duster on the table.

The room is large enough to accommodate about fifty students in a comfortable sitting. There are, however, forty students in our class. Two students sit at each desk.

There are three ceiling fans in the room—two over the students and one over the teacher.
<h2 align="center">Good Health</h2>
<h3 align="center">Health is wealth. There is nothing in our life that is more valuable than good health. Without health there is no happiness, no peace and no success. A person with bad health cannot enjoy the pleasure of being wealthy.

Health is more valuable than money. Money cannot buy health and happiness. But a healthy person remains in a state of bliss and happiness.A  healthy person is completely free from any illness or injury. A person with sound health enjoys a stable health that also includes a healthy mental condition. Our health depends upon several factors, such as food, pollution, sleeping habits, mental condition, air, water and sunlight. Morning walks and Physical exercises are very helpful for the fitness of our mind and body. We should take proper care of our health so that we can enjoy our life completely.

When we are ill or we do not want to play or work, our bad health robs us of sound sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for one, who is constantly ailing. Life has little charm for him. He feels tired of life, always complaining about one thing or the other.

On the other hand, one with good health enjoys his life. When he works or plays he is never tired. A healthy person enjoys good food and sound sleep. For him the world is beautiful and life is all joy.</h3>
